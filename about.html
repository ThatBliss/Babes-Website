            <h2>Who are Babes?</h2>
            <p>We are a community-driven guild that values teamwork, respect, and dedication. Our primary goal is to create a welcoming environment for all members, where everyone can grow and improve their skills together.</p>
            <p>We believe in fostering a positive atmosphere that encourages collaboration and support among our members. Our guild is built on the principles of integrity, inclusivity, and a shared passion for gaming.</p>
            <p>Invested in Our Players: We offer log reviews and tools to help you improve at your own pace, with zero pressure.</p>
            <p>Socially Focused: We believe the guild experience is about more than just gameplay—it’s about the people. We prioritize creating a positive, social environment where members fit with our relaxed, fun-loving mentality.</p>
            <p>Non-Toxic and Inclusive: No raging, no drama. We’re all here to have fun and grow together.</p>
            <p>Discord Vibes: Banter, laughs, and an inclusive, welcoming atmosphere where every player feels valued.</p>
            <p>Babes was founded back i the classic version of World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</p>
            <p>here the guild progressed through every raid, and had a much more hardcore mindset towards raiding.</p>
            <P>A failed start in the next classic expansion Wrath of The Lich King were the destroyer of Babes, and made the guild split up.</P>
            <p>After a small break, the Guild Master Wheatley decided to relaunch the guild in retail, but as a more casual/socially focused guild.</p>

            <h2>Our Values</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be Nice:</strong> We have a zero tolerance policy for any of the stuff that really shouldn't need mentioning, but must be mentioned nonetheless, such as, but not limited to; racism, homophobia, sexism, bigotry, harassment, and bullying. Anyone found breaking this rule will be kicked from the guild and Discord without warning.</li>
                <li><strong>A Home for Everyone:</strong> We want to foster a friendly and positive guild environment, where there's room for people to grow and get better at the game. We all come from vastly different backgrounds when it comes to World of Warcraft, and Babes is and should always be a place for those who are new, or rusty, or an average player to be able to call it their home.</li>
                <li><strong>The Social Aspect:</strong> We value the social side of WoW more than anything else, we would rather recruit a new player that fits in the the guild, than recruit a good player that does not fit in at all. You can always teach people to play better, but you cannot change how people are.</li>
